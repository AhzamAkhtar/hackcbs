## Problem Statement

The problem of password sharing is plaguing the OTT industry. Subscribers often share their login credentials with friends and family, giving unauthorized users access to content they haven't paid for. This practice results in massive financial losses for streaming platforms and devalues the content creators' hard work.

We propose to use Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a unique key to access online content, ensuring that only authorized users can enjoy their favorite movies and shows.

## Solution

- **NFT-Based Authentication:** Users must possess a valid NFT to access OTT content.

- **User Management:** Manage user profiles and NFT ownership.

- **Content Protection:** Protect your intellectual property from unauthorized access.

- **Monetization Options:** Offer premium content as NFTs for purchase or subscription.

- **Customizable:** Easily integrate this solution into your existing OTT platform.
